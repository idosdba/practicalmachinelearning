## Practical Machine Learning 

### Project Writeup

This repo contains files submitted for the Johns Hopkins Practical Machine Learning Project.

* MLProject.Rmd

* MLProject.html

Even though I included the MLProject.html, I couldn't make the gh-pages work.
So used another technique to enable viewing html file.
